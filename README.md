Overview

Beachmeter is a Python script to automate the measurements of beaches based on a new delimitation method on digital elevation models (DEMs) of a coastal zone. It is developed to analyze multi-kilometre shorelines, especially in coastal monitoring. Filling out the Beachmeter form, the user inputs the raster DEMs from two measurement campaigns and information on the study site features. The Beachmeter delimits the beach boundaries and saves them as shapefiles. It creates beach elevation models, compares them to provide a differential map, and also measures the basic morphological parameters.
